## $ CmaccLang = [./CommonAccord] + {{punctuation}}

CommonAccord is a data model and a rendering engine that allows you to create documents in a structured format. These documents can be read both by humans and by machine, making them compatible with blockchain technology. The structured format also makes the solution compatible with the Global Data Protection Regulation, that requires companies to provide users with access to their data, with the right to be forgotten, and moving forward requires portability of the data and privacy by design. While CommonAccord defines the concept of codified law, CmaccLang is an implementation of CommonAccord that adds punctuation and therefore an additional layer of structure. This also allows us to benefit from the features of standard code editors, making the onboarding easier for new comers.
